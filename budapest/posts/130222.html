      <p>This past weekend I visited the Pál-völgyi barlang (cave) up in the hills on the Buda side, overlooking
        downtown Budapest. Previously I had visited the Szemlő-hegyi-barlang and had enjoyed that so much that I decided
        to return to its neighbor. Both of these caves were formed over thousands of years by a variety of factors,
        namely extremely hot thermal waters which pooled up in and pressurized small cracks, slowly making them wider
        and wider until the caves themselves began to take shape. These thermal waters are the very same waters which
        Budapest’s spas utilize, a natural feature for which this city has been called the “spa capital of the world”. I
        found it fascinating to think that a force powerful enough to shape and build rock has become, through
        technological innovation, so “domesticated” that it can be enjoyed as a relaxing pastime or summer activity.
        That is not to say that gaining control over these waters has not come with its own challenges. Our cave guide
        showed us a core sample from the pipes at the most famous bathhouse in the city, the Szechenyi baths. The colors
        of the precipitate minerals on the inside of the pipe matched the same colors that were present in the cave,
        which, according to him, meant that the water in the baths had gone through the very same cycles as the water
        that was once in the caves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main difference between the Pál-völgyi and Szemlő-hegyi caves were their prominent stone formations.
        Pál-völgyi featured the stereotypical stalactites and stalagmites, the remnants of a cave that drained slowly
        and had lots of mineral-rich water dripping through it for many years. It even still had some standing water
        that remained, with pieces of precipitated minerals still visibly floating on the surface. The Szemlő-hegyi cave
        on the other hand is one of only a known handful in the world that possesses what are known as “popcorn”
        formations. These formations were created by mineral-laden steam that sat within the cave for many, many years
        before precipitating, rather than the drip-like formations of the Pál-völgyi cave. These popcorn formations are
        extremely rare because most of the caves that would feature them are either too thin for any human to enter (or
        for them to even qualify as caves, for that matter) or they are still full of deadly steam and haven’t been
        discovered yet. Interestingly enough, the Szemlő-hegyi cave’s air is said to be so clean that the cave is often
        used by local clinics for treating asthma and other respiratory issues.</p>
      <p>
        Due to the discovery of both of these caves and many others that are either not open to the public or are only
        available to professional cavers, the Buda hills have become a popular place to live for speleologists. With the
        most recent cave discovery occurring within the last two decades, there are believed to be even more caves than
        the roughly 5 that have been discovered so far. In recent years, some of these have even been discovered to be
        connected. Overall, I find Budapest’s large number of caves to be a fascinating natural occurrence that not only
        tells a story about how this region was formed long ago, but also demonstrates once more that no matter how deep
        one goes, there is always more to explore.
