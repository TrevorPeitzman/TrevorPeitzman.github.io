    <div class="text-center starter-template">
      <p>Yesterday a group of AIT and BSM students (myself included) travelled north up the Danube on guided tour of
        Visegrád and Szentendre. We got off the train, visited a small church, and walked around the riverside town of
        Nagymaros first thing in the morning. Given some “free time” to explore the town, I wandered off by myself and
        stumbled upon a tiny bakery shop off of one of the side roads that passed through the town. I saw a lot of
        locals going in and out so I decided it must be a good place. I went inside and ordered a cukor follott in my
        best Hungarian, having honestly picked it solely on what it looked like and not knowing at all what it might
        taste like. Just as I was finishing paying and saying kösönöm (thank you), I heard the door open behind me and
        two people walked in speaking English. I stepped aside from the front counter, tucked my change into my wallet,
        and saw that it was Isabel and one other AIT student who had come in! I said “hi” to them, surprisingly catching
        them off-guard. Because I had conducted the entire purchase in Hungarian, they had thought that I was one of the
        locals! We joked about this for the rest of the day, and my confidence for speaking Hungarian while shopping has
        definitely increased.</p>
      <p>
        One of the other interesting things that really stood out to me while walking around Nagymaros was just how
        utterly quiet it was. Maybe it was simply because it was a cold Sunday morning, but even with the occasional car
        the town was very quiet compared to Annapolis and especially compared to Los Angeles. I think the culture of
        walking everywhere definitely contributes to this. Way more than at home in Los Angeles and even more so than in
        Annapolis, the people of Hungary seem much more likely to walk to run errands, get to work, etc. than the people
        in the United States. This combined with the fact that Nagymaros is a smaller town really made the peaceful
        quiet apparent. Even later when we travelled across the water on a ferry to the larger, more city-like Visegrád
        side of the river, the quiet was only broken by a bus or car passing every now and then. However, on the inside,
        Visegrád was loud and lively.</p>
      <p>
        Another part of our tour was a Medieval display of Hungarian warfighting capabilities. Under the shadow of the
        Juliánus Kilátó, a fourteenth-century castle high up on the hill, we watched some wonderful and impressive
        displays of sword fighting, spear-throwing, archery, falconry, and pageantry. This was all re-enacted by a group
        of men who had re-founded the old order of knights that used to reside in the castle above. All of their feats
        were impressive, but what ironically struck me the most was just how close to unsafe they were allowed to be.
        Everything from knife throwing, to archery, to crossbow-shooting, to swordfights happened mere feet away from
        where we were sitting. It was exhilarating and never made me overly fearful that something would go wrong, but
        it did make me think about how something so close to the audience without any form of glass or protection
        between the performers and the guests would never be permitted back in the States. This closeness certainly
        added to the reality as well because of course back in the times these events were actually occurring there
        would be no such thing as safety for the audience.
