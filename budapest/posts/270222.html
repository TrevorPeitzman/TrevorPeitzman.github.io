          <p>This week marked the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

    <div class="text-center starter-template">
      <p>Ever since the war began less than two weeks ago, Ukraine and Russia have been at the forefront of many
        conversations and of most people's minds. Thinking back to 2014 when the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula
        occurred, I remember it seemed so very far away and so unlikely to affect my life. I along with billions of
        people around the globe experienced that event like we do many world events - through the lens of the news
        cameras and the from the voices of people on the ground in the vicinity of that event. Now, the way I am
        experiencing this new war is altogether different. As Hungary shares a border with Ukraine, I am by far the
        closest person to the conflict out of my family and group of friends. That puts me in an interesting position
        not only from their point of view but also in my own. From back in the US, it may seem to some that I must be
        able to see the war firsthand, being so close. While I certainly do not witness fighting in the streets, see
        tanks rolling about, or hear jets and missiles screaming overhead, I do see the tragedy that war has wrought on
        the Ukrainian people firsthand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every so often, on my way back from school, I take a train that departs from the Aquincum station nearest AIT
        and arrives at Nyugati PÃ¡lyaudvar (West Railway Station) which is one of the two main railway stations in
        Budapest. Trains from all over Europe arrive here, alongside the local trains like the one I take. Before
        February 24th, it was somewhat busy at rush hour, but never too crowded. Ever since then, it has been constantly
        busy, new foot traffic control barriers have been put in place, and the police presence has been upped
        significantly as people come from Ukraine escaping the war. A somber tone rests over the majority of the
        conversations that I overhear as I walk through the station.</p>
      <p>
        Remembering from my pre-departure research that Hungary is traditionally not overly fond of immigrants and
        refugees, I was worried that the reception of those coming from Ukraine would be cold. However, I have been
        pleasantly surprised by the kindness and welcoming attitude of the Hungarian people. Despite the Hungarian
        government's overall lack of official aid to the refugees, individual citizens and volunteer organizations have
        rallied together to provide food, water, housing, and any assistance they can. Signs in many different languages
        have popped up across the station, detailing where the closest bathroom is, where to find food, shelter, and
        WIFI, as well as how to buy tickets for connecting trains to other parts of Europe. I personally had the
        opportunity to help out a Ukrainian gentleman as he overheard me speaking English to one of my friends and
        stopped us to ask if we could help get him to a place to change his money that someone had recommended to him.
        When he showed me the map of where it was, I knew there was a much closer place that I had been to before, so
        instead I showed him the way there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing firsthand how so many people are affected by war has reinforced the gravity of the profession I am about
        to enter, and will certainly stay in the back of my mind as I make decisions in the fleet.
