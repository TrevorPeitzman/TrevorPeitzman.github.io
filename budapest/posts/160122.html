      <p>One cultural difference that really struck me from the day I got here is that most everyone I have speaks at
        least two languages, and typically speaks them pretty well too. Even though I knew that many Hungarians spoke at
        least a little English from researching ahead of time, I still had this “romanticized” view of travelling abroad
        in which I would have to get really good at pointing, body language, or typing into Google Translate in order to
        be able to communicate with anyone at all. Instead, the first person we truly met in Hungary, Aron, our driver
        from the airport, spoke great English. When making small talk with him, I remarked as I feel many Americans do
        that I know that English can be challenging because of all the similar spellings that are pronounced
        differently. To my surprise he basically said that this is a common misconception and that the English language
        is actually quite easy to learn. He thought this is due to the fact that Hungarian is one of the hardest
        languages to learn and thus English must be easier by comparison, but I am convinced that it is also the pride
        of the native English-speaker that we believe English must be the most challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the many restaurants that I have visited as well, most if not all of the wait staff is fully fluent in both
        Hungarian and English (And often German, French, Dutch or some other European language). Given the differences
        in all of these cultures, their customer service is exceptional. All in all, the fact that as an American I am
        only truly fluent in English speaks volumes to the cultural differences between Hungary and the United States.
        It also really puts into perspective just how close together Europe really is and how many different cultural
        experiences it contains. </p>
      <p>
        This is also fascinating in the way in which products are packaged. In the US we are so used to having
        everything in English everywhere and only sometimes maybe the directions/user manual have more than just English
        and Spanish in them. Here on the other hand, in the grocery stores even products as obvious as pasta have
        nutrition facts, ingredients, and cooking directions in every language from Hungarian to English to French and
        German. This makes it seem much more inclusive than supermarkets in the US, but it also changes the packaging as
        there has to be a lot more text on the product. Thus it seems that flashy packaging and bright colors aren't as
        common in Hungarian grocery stores as they are in the States. To that same end, the customers in the grocery
        stores here seem much more focused on buying exactly what they need rather than being told by some marketing
        scheme or “super deal” what they should be buying.
